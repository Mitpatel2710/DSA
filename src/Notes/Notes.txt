LinkedList is a data structure for storing a collection of items.

Drawbacks of Arrays data type:
1.  When you initialize an array object, the slots with in the array cannot be increased,
    for eg if the size of the array is for 100 items, you cannot add 101 items
    you will have to create a new larger array and copy all of that data over from smaller one and
2.  if you want to insert data into a slot somewhere in the middle of the array, you cannot just tell
    all the item to move over and make some room.
3.  You will actually have to iterate over the array and reassign each of those items to bigger index val
    and you can imagine all kinds of struggle to fix this


DataStructure.linkedlist:
You can insert data to the beginning of the list or somewhere in the middle here, and all the values
are going to be pushed over automatically or all the way at the end of the list of items without having
to worry about any fixed size limitation or anything like that.
You can grow the size of the collection as much as you want.
last node in link always has to link to null it points to null

Assignment:
I want you to create a class defination for node, keep in mind that it will have two instance variables
One of them obviously is going to be of type int, bcz the nodes we have here in this example store int data
and the other instance variable is going to be of type node
its going to be a recursive data type.
